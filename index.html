        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
            I have worked as a construction industry professional for the last 15 years,
            but have always enjoyed exploring the inner workings of my computers over the years, often doubling up as a first line IT technician for my office.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last few years I have really dived deep into exploring the capability of computers big ad small, from classic Amstrad computers to Arduino microcontrollers to building my own desktop. I am now certified GFACT and GSEC in cyber security, have completed a software engineering bootcamp provided by HyperionDev in partnership with the University of Manchester, and am about to finish my BSc Computer Science degree from the Goldsmith's, University of London.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about using software to create valuable products or services while solving problems that society didn't know existed. My strongest technical skills include Python, Django, Linux, C++ and SQL
